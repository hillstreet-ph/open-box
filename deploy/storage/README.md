# Open-Box Master Storage Ingestion

## Website connection readiness

The Cloudflare gateway exposes two credential-free onboarding surfaces:

- `/connect-storage` — administrator guide for connecting Google Drive, Dropbox,
  OneDrive, and Box accounts later.
- `/api/open-box/storage-providers` — machine-readable provider and mount-path
  metadata for the onboarding page and operational checks.

These routes never accept or return OAuth credentials. Google Drive, Dropbox,
and OneDrive credentials are added through the authenticated OpenList storage
manager. Box is collected through the rclone worker because this OpenList build
does not include a native Box driver.

## Policy

Open-Box uses a non-destructive, one-way collection model:

`Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive -> rclone copy -> Master Storage -> OpenList`

Original files remain in their source providers. Source deletion never automatically deletes the collected master copy. Master deletion never modifies a source account.

## Sources

- Google Drive: Personal-01, Personal-02, Workspace-01, Shared-Drive-01
- Dropbox: Account-01, Account-02
- OneDrive: Personal-01, Business-01, Business-02

## Security

Never commit OAuth refresh tokens, client secrets, passwords, S3 keys, or a populated `rclone.conf`. The repository contains only a template. Mount the real configuration at `/config/rclone/rclone.conf` from a secret/persistent runtime location.

Where possible, source credentials should be read-only. Master credentials require write access only to the designated Open-Box prefix/bucket.

## Master layout

```
open-box/
  sources/
    google-personal-01/
    google-personal-02/
    google-workspace-01/
    google-shared-drive-01/
    dropbox-account-01/
    dropbox-account-02/
    onedrive-personal-01/
    onedrive-business-01/
    onedrive-business-02/
```

This first implementation preserves provenance by source. A catalog/index layer can subsequently expose a logical Unified Library and content-hash deduplication without deleting source originals.

## Collection

Run `deploy/storage/collect.sh` in an rclone container/worker with:

- `/config/rclone/rclone.conf` mounted read-only
- `/logs` persistent
- environment `MASTER_REMOTE=master`
- environment `MASTER_ROOT=open-box`

The script deliberately uses `rclone copy`, not `rclone sync`.

## Deduplication design

Do not deduplicate by filename. The inventory layer should track provider, account, source object/path, size, modified time, content hash when available/calculated, master object key, verification status, and timestamps. Identical content may reference one canonical master object while retaining every source relationship.

## Recovery

OpenList application state must remain on its persistent `/opt/openlist/data` volume. Master Storage must be independent of the OpenList container/server. If OpenList is replaced, restore its persistent state and remount Master Storage; source and master files remain independently stored.
